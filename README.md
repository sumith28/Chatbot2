Chatbot


🛠️ Tools and Technologies
	1.Programming Language: Python
	2.NLP Libraries:
		NLTK
		Scikit-learn (TF-IDF Vectorizer and Logistic Regression)
	3.Frontend Framework: Streamlit
	4.Machine Learning: Logistic Regression, BERT-based embeddings
	5.Utilities:
		csv for logging conversations
		datetime for timestamps
		os and json for file handling

  🧠 Methodology
	1.Data Preparation
			Intent data stored in a structured JSON format.
	2.Model Development
			TF-IDF vectorizer converts user inputs into numerical features.
			Logistic Regression model classifies inputs into predefined intents.
	3.Response Mechanism
			Classified intents or matched FAQs return specific responses.
			Fallback mechanism ensures meaningful engagement for unrecognized queries.
	4.Interface and Deployment
			Streamlit provides an interactive web-based interface for user interactions.
